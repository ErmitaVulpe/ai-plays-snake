### attempt 1
This was my first ever attemt at building a neural network, it went pretty bad.  

### attemp 2
Learned my lessons from toying around with ai.py but i didn't predict recursion issues in my design.

### attempt 3
this was the first successful attempt. I was able to build a fully connected network that after ~60 generations was able to score 50 points which isn't that bad. But due to the way i kept track of the nodes and layers in the network it was very hard to add any new layers.
